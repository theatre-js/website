## What is an Object in Theatre.js?

Everything on the page or in the scene is represented by a Theatre.js Sheet Object.
These Sheet Objects have a matching [prop](/docs/0.5/manual/prop-types) for all the properties we want to animate for an object in our scene.

Sheet Object props in all cases have a type (`number`, `string`, etc.), and an initial value.

Objects can represent THREE.js objects, `<div>`s, or virtual objects that don't exist on the screen.

## Creating Sheet Objects

You can create a Sheet Object with the [Sheet.object](/docs/0.5/api/core#sheet.object) function in `@theatre/core`.
If a Sheet Object with the given name already exists, it will return the existing Sheet Object instead of creating a new one.
We create a Sheet Object by specifying its name and its props. In many cases, you can use a regular JavaScript object to specify the props,
however if you need more control, you can specify the types [explicitly](/docs/0.5/manual/prop-types).

```ts
// sheet is a Sheet created earlier through Poject.sheet
const myObject = sheet.object('My Object', { position: { x: 0, y: 0 } })
```

## Namespacing objects

The key of the sheet object can be used to namespace objects.
Namespaces are separated by "/" characters in the object's key (e.g. "Namespace-1/Namespace-2/Object-name") and displayed in indented groups in the [Outline Panel](/docs/0.5/manual/Studio#outline-panel) as seen in the screenshot below.

```ts
// `obj1` and `obj2` belong to the `Boxes` namepace,
// which is under the `Basics` namespace
const obj1 = sheet.object('Basics/Boxes/box-0', { x: 0 })
const obj2 = sheet.object('Basics/Boxes/box-1', { x: 0 })
```
