## What is an Object in Theatre.js?

Everything on the page or in the scene is represented by a Theatre.js Sheet Object.
These Sheet Objects have a matching [prop](/docs/0.5/manual/prop-types) for all the properties we want to animate for an object in our scene.

Sheet Object props in all cases have a type (`number`, `string`, etc.), and an initial value.

Objects can represent THREE.js objects, `<div>`s, or virtual objects that don't exist on the screen.

## Creating Sheet Objects

You can create a Sheet Object with the [Sheet.object](/docs/0.5/api/core#sheet.object) function in `@theatre/core`.
If a Sheet Object with the given name already exists, it will return the existing Sheet Object instead of creating a new one.
We create a Sheet Object by specifying its name and its props. In many cases, you can use a regular JavaScript object to specify the props,
however if you need more control, you can specify the types [explicitly](/docs/0.5/manual/prop-types).

```ts
// sheet is a Sheet created earlier through Poject.sheet
const myObject = sheet.object('My Object', { position: { x: 0, y: 0 } })
```

## Reconfiguring existing objects <Since version="0.5.1" />

Objects can be reconfigured on the fly. For example, you can add a `rotation` prop to a live object without having to refresh the page.
Simply call `sheet.object()` with `{reconfigure: true}` and the existing object will be reconfigured.

```ts
const obj = sheet.object('obj', { foo: 0 })
console.log(obj.value.foo) // prints 0
// mark[46:66]
const obj2 = sheet.object('obj', { bar: 0 }, { reconfigure: true })

console.log(obj.value.foo) // prints undefined, since we've removed this prop via reconfiguring the object

console.log(obj.value.bar) // prints 0, since we've introduced this prop by reconfiguring the object

assert(obj === obj2) // passes, because reconfiguring the object returns the same object
```

## Detaching objects <Since version="0.5.1" />

Objects can be detached from their sheet. This is _almost_ like deleting an object, except that Theatre will still _remember_ the prop values of this object, so if you re-create an object with the same `key`, it'll retain the old object's props values.

```ts
const obj = sheet.object('obj', { foo: 0 })
const unsubscribe = obj.onValuesChange((values) => {
  div.style.left = values.x + 'px'
})

// let's clean up our subscriptions before detaching the object
unsubscribe()
sheet.detachObject('obj')
```

## Namespacing objects

The key of the sheet object can be used to namespace objects.
Namespaces are separated by "/" characters in the object's key (e.g. "Namespace-1 / Namespace-2 / Object-name") and displayed in indented groups in the [Outline Panel](/docs/0.5/manual/Studio#outline-panel) as seen in the screenshot below.

```ts
// `obj1` and `obj2` belong to the `Boxes` namepace,
// which is under the `Basics` namespace
const obj1 = sheet.object('Basics / Boxes / box-0', { x: 0 })
const obj2 = sheet.object('Basics / Boxes / box-1', { x: 0 })
```
