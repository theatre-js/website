## getProject$api(id, config)

If you import and [initialize Studio](/docs/latest/api/studio#studio.initialize-fn), you can call `getProject()` without an explicit state.
In this case, the state of the project will be managed by Studio.

```ts
import { getProject } from '@theatre/core'
const config = {} // the config can be empty when starting a new project
const project = getProject('My Project', config)
```

In production, however, you'd pass a state object, which is exported from Studio in the config argument.

```ts
import { getProject } from '@theatre/core'
import state from './saved-state.json'
const config = { state } // here the config contains our saved state
const project = getProject('My Project', config)
```

## Project

Project returned by `getProject`.

_To read about Projects, check out the [Projects Manual](/docs/latest/manual/projects)!_

### project.ready $api

`Promise` that resolves when Theatre.js is loaded. If `@theatre/studio` is used, this `Promise` would resolve when Studio has loaded the state of the project into memory. If `@theatre/studio` is not used, this `Promise` is already resolved.

```ts
project.ready.then(() => console.log('Project loaded!'))
```

### project.isReady $api

Indicates whether the project is ready to be used.
It is better to use [Project.ready](#project.ready), which is a `Promise` that resolves when the project is ready.

```ts
if (project.isReady) {
  console.log('Project loaded!')
} else {
  console.log('Project not loaded yet.')
}
```

### project.address $api

The Project's unique address in Theatre.js.
It is a JS object that contains a single property `projectId`.

```ts
const { projectId } = project.address
```

### project.sheet$api(name, instanceId?)

Creates or returns a [Sheet](#sheet) under the Project.
If a Sheet with the given name is in the Project's state then the existing Sheet is returned; otherwise, a new Sheet is created and returned.
You can optionally give a second argument: a sheet instance id that allows you to create multiple instances of the same Sheet
(this makes it possible to have multiple instances of the same animation).
By default, the instance id is the same as the Sheet id.

```ts
import { getProject } from '@theatre/core'

const project = getProject('My Project')
const sheet = project.sheet('My Sheet', 'My optional Sheet instance id')
```

### project.getAssetUrl$api(assetHandle) <Since version="0.6.0" />

Gets the url for the provided asset handle.
You would normally get an asset handle by listening to changes of asset props, like the image prop.

```ts
const object = sheet.object('My Object', {
  texture: types.image(undefined, {
    label: 'Texture',
  }),
})

object.onValuesChange(({ texture }) => {
  setImageUrl(project.getAssetUrl(texture))
})
```

## Sheet

Sheet returned by [`Project.sheet`](#project.sheet).

### sheet.object$api(key, config, options?)

Creates or returns an [Object](#object) with given props under this Sheet.
If an Object with the given name is in the Project's state then the existing Object is returned; otherwise, a new Object is created and returned.

```ts
// Create an object with nested props
const myObject = sheet.object('My Object', { position: { x: 0, y: 0 } })

// {x: 0, y: 0}
console.log(myObject.value.position)
```

Objects can also be reconfigured on the fly. Learn more [here](/docs/latest/manual/objects#reconfiguring-existing-objects).

### sheet.detachObject$api(key) <Since version="0.5.1" />

Detaches a previously created child object from the sheet.

If you call `sheet.object(key)` again with the same `key`, the values of the object's props WILL NOT be reset to their initial values.

<Callout type="info">
  **Note**: Calling `sheet.detachObject()` does _not_ unsubscribe the listeners you've attached to the object. For
  example, if you've called [`const unsubscribe = object.onValuesChange(...)`](#object.onvalueschange_callback_), you
  will have to manually call `unsubscribe()` either before or after calling `sheet.detachObject()`.
</Callout>

### sheet.sequence $api

The [Sequence](#sequence) of this sheet. Sequences are JS objects that hold animation data such as Keyframes and current position.

### sheet.project $api

The [Project](#project) this Sheet belongs to.

```ts
import { getProject } from '@theatre/core'

const project = getProject('My Project')
const sheet = project.sheet('My Sheet')

// true
console.log(sheet.project === project)
```

### sheet.address $api

The Sheet's unique address in Theatre.js.
It is an object containing a `projectId`, `sheetId`, and `sheetInstanceId`.

```ts
import { getProject } from '@theatre/core'

const project = getProject('My Project')
const sheet = project.sheet('My Sheet')

const { projectId, sheetId, sheetInstanceId } = sheet.address
```

## Sequence

A JS object that holds animation data such as Keyframes and current position.

### sequence.play$api(opts?)

Starts playback of a sequence. Returns a `Promise` that either resolves to `true` when the playback completes or resolves
to `false` if playback gets interrupted (for example by calling [`Sequence.pause`](#sequence.pause))

```ts
// plays the sequence from the current position to sequence.length
sheet.sequence.play()

// plays the sequence at 2.4x speed
sheet.sequence.play({ rate: 2.4 })

// plays the sequence from second 1 to 4
sheet.sequence.play({ range: [1, 4] })

// plays the sequence 4 times
sheet.sequence.play({ iterationCount: 4 })

// plays the sequence in reverse
sheet.sequence.play({ direction: 'reverse' })

// plays the sequence back and forth forever (until interrupted)
sheet.sequence.play({ iterationCount: Infinity, direction: 'alternateReverse' })

// plays the sequence and logs "done" once playback is finished
sheet.sequence.play().then(() => console.log('done'))

// play the sequence using the given rafDriver (since version 0.6.0)
sheet.sequence.play({ rafDriver })
```

_Hint: You can control how often `sequence.play()` progresses forward by optionally providing a [`rafDriver`](/docs/latest/manual/advanced#rafdrivers)._

### sequence.pause$api()

Pauses the currently playing animation.

```ts
sheet.sequence.play()
setTimeout(() => sheet.sequence.pause(), 1000) // pause after 1 second
```

### sequence.position $api

The current position of the playhead. In a time-based sequence, this represents the current time in seconds.

```ts
// if the animation is past the 1 second mark
if (sheet.sequence.position > 1) {
  // do something
}
```

```ts
// set the animation position to 1 second
sheet.sequence.position = 1
```

### sequence.pointer $api

A [Pointer](/docs/latest/api/core#pointers) to the Sequence's inner state.

As with any Pointer, you can use this with [`onChange()`](#onchange) to listen to its value changes or with `val()` to read its current value.

```ts
import { onChange, val } from '@theatre/core'

// ...

onChange(sequence.pointer.length, (len) => {
  console.log('Length of the sequence changed to:', len)
})

onChange(sequence.pointer.position, (position) => {
  console.log('Position of the sequence changed to:', position)
})

onChange(sequence.pointer.playing, (playing) => {
  console.log(playing ? 'playing' : 'paused')
})

// we can also read the current value of the pointer
console.log('current length is', val(sequence.pointer.length))
```

### sequence.attachAudio$api(opts)

Attaches an audio source to the sequence.
Playing the sequence automatically plays the audio source and the audio and animation times are kept in sync.

Returns a `Promise` that resolves once the audio source is loaded and decoded.

Learn more from the [Using Audio](/docs/latest/manual/audio) manual.

```ts
// Loads and decodes audio from the URL and then attaches it to the sequence
await sheet.sequence.attachAudio({source: "http://localhost:3000/audio.mp3"})
sheet.sequence.play()

// Providing your own AudioAPI Context, destination, etc
const audioContext: AudioContext = {...} // create an AudioContext using the Audio API
const audioBuffer: AudioBuffer = {...} // create an AudioBuffer
const destinationNode = audioContext.destination

await sheet.sequence.attachAudio({source: audioBuffer, audioContext, destinationNode})
```

Note: It's better to provide the `audioContext` rather than allow Theatre.js to create it. That's because some browsers
[suspend the `audioContext`](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/#webaudio) unless it's initiated by a user
gesture, like a click. If that happens, Theatre.js will wait for a user gesture to resume the `audioContext`. But that's
probably not an optimal user experience. It is better to provide a button or some other UI element to communicate to
the user that they have to initiate the animation.

```ts
// html: <button id="#start">start</button>
const button = document.getElementById('start')

button.addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const audioContext = somehowCreateAudioContext()
  await sheet.sequence.attachAudio({ audioContext, source: '...' })
  sheet.sequence.play()
})
```

_To read about Audio, check out the [Using Audio Manual](/docs/latest/manual/audio)!_

### sequence.\_\_experimental_getKeyframes$api(pointer) <Since version="0.6.1" />

Returns the keyframes of a given prop of an object.

```ts
const obj = sheet.object('My Object', { position: { x: 0, y: 0 } })

// (assuming the user has sequenced the x prop)
const keyframes = sequence.__experimental_getKeyframes(obj.props.position.x) // an array of keyframes
```

## Object

A Sheet Object returned by [`sheet.object`](#sheet.object) with some given props.

```ts
const obj = sheet.object('My Object', { x: 0 })
```

_To read about Objects, check out the [Objects Manual](/docs/latest/manual/objects)._

_To read about the props of Objects, check out the [Prop Types Manual](/docs/latest/manual/prop-types) or the [Prop types API docs](#prop-types) below!_

### object.value $api

The current values of the props of the Object.

```ts
const obj = sheet.object('obj', { x: 0 })
console.log(obj.value.x) // prints 0 or the current numeric value
```

### object.props $api

A [Pointer](/docs/latest/api/core#pointers) to the props of the Object.

```ts
onChange(obj.props.x, (x) => {
  console.log(x)
})
// we can also read the current value of the pointer
console.log('current x is', val(obj.props.x))
```

### object.sheet $api

The instance of [Sheet](#sheet) that the Object belongs to.

```ts
const sheet = project.sheet('My Sheet')
const obj = sheet.object('obj', { x: 0 })

// true
console.log(obj.sheet === sheet)
```

### object.project $api

The [Project](#project) this object belongs to.

```ts
const project = getProject('My Project')
const sheet = project.sheet('My Sheet')
const obj = sheet.object('My Object', { x: 0 })

// true
console.log(obj.project === project)
```

### object.address $api

An Object address is a JS object representing the unique address of the Object in Theatre.js.
It contains a `projectId`, `sheetId`, `sheetInstanceId` , and `objectKey`.

```ts
const { projectId, sheetId, sheetInstanceId, objectKey } = obj.address
```

### object.initialValue $api

Sets the initial value of the Object.
This value overrides the default values defined in the Object's [prop types](#prop-types).
And, it can then be overridden if the user [overrides it in the Studio UI](/docs/latest/manual/sequences#sequencing-props) with a static or sequenced value.

```ts
const obj = sheet.object('obj', { position: { x: 0, y: 0 } })

obj.value // {position: {x: 0, y: 0}}

// here, we only override position.x
obj.initialValue = { position: { x: 2 } }

obj.value // {position: {x: 2, y: 0}}
```

### object.onValuesChange$api(callback)

Calls a given callback every time any of the Object's prop values change.

Returns an unsubscribe function that can be called to stop listening.

```ts
const obj = sheet.object('Box', { position: { x: 0, y: 0 } })
const div = document.getElementById('box')

const unsubscribe = obj.onValuesChange((newValues) => {
  div.style.left = newValues.position.x + 'px'
  div.style.top = newValues.position.y + 'px'
})

// you can call unsubscribe() to stop listening to changes
```

## Prop types

You can define the types of props when creating an [Object](#object) through [`sheet.object`](#sheet-object) using the `types` object.

```ts
import { types } from '@theatre/core'
```

Many prop types allow you to omit the type, and the type is inferred from the initial prop values you provide.
For example, in the following code snippet, the "My Object" Object has a single prop `x` with an inferred prop type [`types.number`](#types.number).

```ts
// A simple number prop
const obj = sheet.object('My Object', { x: 0 })
```

In cases where you want more control over your Object's props, you can specify the type explicitly.
Prop types accept options that alter the way the prop behaves when sequenced or displayed in the Studio UI.

```ts
// A number prop with custom UI
const obj = sheet.object('My Object', {
  x: types.number(0, {
    // limited to 0 and 10
    range: [0, 10],
  }),
})
```

<div id="docs-500-api-100-core-custom-interpolators">
  For `stringLiteral`, `string`, and `boolean` types, we can define a custom interpolator as an option, see the code
  below for an example.
</div>

```ts
/**
 * A string interpolator for a "typewriter effect" when `left` is an empty
 * string or `right` starts with `left`.
 */
const typeWriterInterpolate = (left: string, right: string, progression: number) => {
  if (!left || right.startsWith(left)) {
    const length = Math.floor(Math.max(0, (right.length - left.length) * progression))
    return left + right.slice(left.length, left.length + length)
  }
  return left
}

const obj = sheet.object('My Object', {
  title: types.string('', { interpolate: typeWriterInterpolate }),
})
```

_To read about Prop types, check out the [Prop Types Manual](/docs/latest/manual/prop-types)!_

### types.compound$api(props, opts?)

Compound props are analogous to JavaScript objects in that they enable the nesting of props.
In the example below, `position` has an inferred prop type of `types.compound`.

```ts
const obj = sheet.object('My Object', {
  position: {
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
  },
})

assert(obj.value.position.x === 0)
```

You can pass additional options when specifying compound types explicitly.

```ts
const obj = sheet.object('My Object', {
  position: types.compound(
    { x: 0, y: 0 },
    // a custom label for the prop:
    { label: 'Position' },
  ),
})
```

### types.number$api(default, opts?)

A number prop type.

```ts
const x = types.number(0, {
  // The range allowed in the UI (just a visual guide, not a validation rule)
  range: [0, 10],
  // Factor influencing the mouse-sensitivity when scrubbing the input
  nudgeMultiplier: 0.1,
})

// Number prop with a custom nudging function
const y = types.number({
  nudgeFn: (
    // The mouse movement (in pixels)
    deltaX: number,
    // The movement as a fraction of the width of the number editor's input
    deltaFraction: number,
    // A multiplier that's usually 1, but might be another number if user wants to nudge slower/faster
    magnitude: number,
    // The configuration of the number
    config: { nudgeMultiplier?: number; range?: [number, number] },
  ): number => {
    return deltaX * magnitude
  },
})
```

### types.rgba$api(default?)

An RGBA prop type. All color channels are normalized between 0 and 1.

```ts
// red
const color = types.rgba({ r: 1, g: 0, b: 0, a: 1 })
```

### types.boolean$api(default)

A boolean prop type.
This prop type may take [a custom interpolator](#docs-500-api-100-core-custom-interpolators) as an option.

```ts
const isOn = types.boolean(true)
```

### types.string$api(default, opts?)

A string prop type.
This prop type may take [a custom interpolator](#docs-500-api-100-core-custom-interpolators) as an option.

```ts
const message = types.string('Animation Loading')
```

### types.stringLiteral$api(default, choices, opts?)

A stringLiteral prop type, useful for building menus or radio buttons.
This prop type may take [a custom interpolator](#docs-500-api-100-core-custom-interpolators) as an option.

String literals can be presented as radio buttons.

```ts
const light = types.stringLiteral('r', { r: 'Red', g: 'Green' }, { as: 'switch', label: 'Street Light' })
```

Or as menus.

```ts
const light = types.stringLiteral('r', { r: 'Red', g: 'Green' }, { as: 'menu', label: 'Street Light' })
```

### types.image$api(default, opts?) <Since version="0.6.0" />

An image prop type.
This prop type may take [a custom interpolator](#docs-500-api-100-core-custom-interpolators) as an option.

Image props are asset props, meaning their values are asset handles that can be used to [retrieve a URL for that asset](#project.getasseturl_assethandle_).

The default value for image props is the id of the default asset. If you don't know the id, an empty string or `undefined` represents the lack of an assigned asset.

```ts
const texture = types.image('', {
  label: 'Texture',
})
```

### types.file$api(default, opts?) <Since version="0.7.0" />

An file prop type.
This prop type may take [a custom interpolator](#docs-500-api-100-core-custom-interpolators) as an option.

File props are asset props, meaning their values are asset handles that can be used to [retrieve a URL for that asset](#project.getasseturl_assethandle_).

The default value for file props is the id of the default asset. If you don't know the id, an empty string or `undefined` represents the lack of an assigned asset.

```ts
const model = types.file('', {
  label: '3D Model (GLTF)',
})
```

## Pointers

Pointers basically point to values that you can [read](/docs/latest/api/core#val-fn), [observe](/docs/latest/api/core#onchange-fn), and in some cases [change](/docs/latest/api/studio#studio.transaction-fn).

### onChange$api(pointer, callback, rafDriver?)

Takes a Pointer as the first argument and a callback as the second argument.
Calls the callback every time the value pointed to by `pointer` changes.

Returns an unsubscribe function.

```ts
import { getProject, onChange } from '@theatre/core'

const obj = getProject('A project')
  .sheet('Scene')
  .object('Box', { position: { x: 0 } })

const usubscribe = onChange(obj.props.position.x, (x) => {
  console.log('position.x changed to:', x)
})

setTimeout(usubscribe, 10000) // stop listening to changes after 10 seconds
```

_Hint: You can control how often `onChange()` calls the callback by optoinally providing a [`rafDriver`](/docs/latest/manual/advanced#rafdrivers)._

### val$api(pointer)

Takes a Pointer and returns the value it points to.

```ts
import { val, getProject } from '@theatre/core'

const obj = getProject('A project')
  .sheet('Scene')
  .object('Box', { position: { x: 0 } })

console.log(val(obj.props.position.x)) // logs the value of obj.props.x
```
