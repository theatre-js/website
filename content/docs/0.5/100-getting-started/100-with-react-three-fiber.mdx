title: With React Three Fiber
excerpt: >
  Animate a React Three Fiber project using Theatre.js's r3f extension, "@theatre/r3f".
  This guide assumes that you have a web project with a bundler set up.
---

In this guide, you'll learn how to animate a 3D scene by integrating Theatre.js into a [`@react-three/fiber`](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber) project using the `@theatre/r3f` extension. For a plain Three.js guide, see [Getting started with THREE.js](/docs/0.5/getting-started/with-three-js).

**While Theatre.js is library-agnostic, extensions help you more easily integrate it with other tools, frameworks, and libraries.**

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have a web project with a bundler set up.
Don't have one?
No problem, you can follow one of the popular bundler getting start guides: [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started), [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/getting-started/),
[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting-started/webapp/), or [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#trying-vite-online) (recommended).

Once you're set up, navigate to the folder containing the project in your terminal, and you're ready to get started.

## Installing dependencies

Run the commands below to install the dependencies we'll be using.

Notice that we are also using `@react-three/drei`, a library that provides useful helpers for React Three Fiber.
We will use it to add a custom camera that we can tweak with Theatre.js.

```bash
# r3f and its dependencies
npm install --save react three @react-three/fiber

# Theatre.js
npm install --save @theatre/core@0.5 @theatre/studio@0.5 @theatre/r3f@0.5

# Three.js types (when using Typescript)
npm install --save-dev @types/three
```

<details>
  <summary>Want to use `yarn`?</summary>

```bash
# r3f and its deps
yarn add react three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei

# Theatre.js
yarn add @theatre/core@0.5 @theatre/studio@0.5 @theatre/r3f@0.5

# Three.js types (when using Typescript)
yarn add --dev @types/three
```

</details>

## R3F starter code

We will start with the following simple r3f code, and then we'll see how we can add Theatre.js to it.

<Callout type="info">
  The code in this guide is TypeScript. You can follow along in JavaScript by removing the type annotations.
</Callout>

To start, we'll create a `main.tsx` file containing the code in the code block below.
For example, if you're using the [vite react-ts starter](https://vite.new/react-ts), you can replace the entire contents of the `main.tsx` file with the following:

```tsx
import * as THREE from 'three'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import React, { useRef, useState } from 'react'
import { Canvas, useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { PerspectiveCamera } from '@react-three/drei'
import { getProject } from '@theatre/core'

// our Theatre.js project sheet, we'll use this later
const demoSheet = getProject('Demo Project').sheet('Demo Sheet')

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <PerspectiveCamera makeDefault position={[5, 5, -5]} fov={75} />
      <ambientLight />
      <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
      <mesh>
        <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
        <meshStandardMaterial color="orange" />
      </mesh>
    </Canvas>
  )
}

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(<App />)
```

<Callout type="info">
  Tip: To make the canvas full-screen, you can add the following rules to your CSS: `height: 100vh; margin: 0;`
</Callout>

Once you've saved, ran your bundler, and opened the bundled webpage in your browser, you will see something like the following screenshot:

<Screenshot src="/images/docs/0.5/getting-started/with-react-three-fiber/starting-screenshot.png" />

## Adding the Studio UI

Now, let's add Theatre.js Studio, the Theatre.js GUI that enables you to edit your scene and animations while developing your project.

Add the following lines below the other imports in `main.tsx` to [initialize](/docs/0.5/api/studio#studio.initialize) Theatre.js Studio.

```ts
import studio from '@theatre/studio'

studio.initialize()
```

<Screenshot src="/images/docs/0.5/getting-started/with-react-three-fiber/starting-screenshot-plus-studio.png" />

You will now see the Studio appear on top of your webpage.
However, the r3f extension is still missing.
Let's add the extension by calling [studio.extend](/docs/0.5/api/studio#studio.extend):

```ts
import studio from '@theatre/studio'
import extension from '@theatre/r3f/dist/extension'

studio.initialize()
studio.extend(extension)
```

You can call [studio.extend](/docs/0.5/api/studio#studio.extend) as many times as you want, once for any extension you want to use.
You can even [make your own extension](/docs/0.5/manual/authoring-extensions) to extend Theatre.js's capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Tip: only include Theatre.js Studio in "development" builds</summary>

If your environment supports it, you can wrap the above code in an environment check to ensure you only include Studio in "development" builds of your webpage.

```ts
// Vite
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
  studio.initialize()
  studio.extend(extension)
}
```

```ts
// create-react-app
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  studio.initialize()
  studio.extend(extension)
}
```

</details>

After extending Theatre.js with the r3f extension, a new button will appear in the top left of the UI:

<Screenshot src="/images/docs/0.5/getting-started/with-react-three-fiber/studio-with-extension.png" />

Clicking on it will bring up the scene editor, but the editor will contain an empty space because it is not connected to our scene yet.

<Screenshot src="/images/docs/0.5/getting-started/with-react-three-fiber/scene-not-connected.png" />

We can connect our scene to the r3f extension by wrapping our r3f scene in a [SheetProvider](/docs/0.5/api/r3f#sheetprovider) component,
which will make the scene visible in the editor. Let's do that.

Add an import of [SheetProvider](/docs/0.5/api/r3f#sheetprovider) from `@theatre/r3f`:

```tsx
import { SheetProvider } from '@theatre/r3f'
```

Then, add a wrapping `<SheetProvider sheet={demoSheet}>` with reference to the `demoSheet` from above:

```tsx
<Canvas camera={{ position: [5, 5, -5] }}>
  {/* Provide sheet created earlier with `const demoSheet = getProject('Demo Project').sheet('Demo Sheet')` */}
  <SheetProvider sheet={demoSheet}>
    <PerspectiveCamera makeDefault position={[5, 5, -5]} fov={75} />
    <ambientLight />
    <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
    <mesh>
      <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial color="orange" />
    </mesh>
  </SheetProvider>
</Canvas>
```

Now, our little yellow cube will show up in Theatre.js' r3f snapshot editor:

<Screenshot src="/images/docs/0.5/getting-started/with-react-three-fiber/scene-connected.png" />

## Making objects editable

While we can now see objects and move around the scene in the editor, we cannot edit the objects yet.
We need to mark objects as editable for the r3f extension to be able to instrument their values.

To make an object editable, import `editable as e` from the extension.

```tsx
import { editable as e, SheetProvider } from '@theatre/r3f'
```

Then prefix the object's JSX element with `e.`, and add the `theatreKey` prop.
The following code will make the point light object editable:

```tsx
<Canvas camera={{ position: [5, 5, -5] }}>
  <SheetProvider sheet={getProject('Demo Project').sheet('Demo Sheet')}>
    <PerspectiveCamera makeDefault position={[5, 5, -5]} fov={75} />
    <ambientLight />
    <e.pointLight theatreKey="Light" position={[10, 10, 10]} />
    <mesh>
      <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial color="orange" />
    </mesh>
  </SheetProvider>
</Canvas>
```

We can verify that the point light object is editable by opening the scene editor and

- click-dragging on the point light to move it around, or
- clicking the object to select it, and then editing its properties in the property editor panel in the top right of the Studio UI.

<Screenshot src="/images/docs/0.5/getting-started/with-react-three-fiber/light-editable.png" />

We can make the cube editable in the same way:

```tsx
<Canvas camera={{ position: [5, 5, -5] }}>
  <SheetProvider sheet={getProject('Demo Project').sheet('Demo Sheet')}>
    <PerspectiveCamera makeDefault position={[5, 5, -5]} fov={75} />
    <ambientLight />
    <e.pointLight theatreKey="Light" position={[10, 10, 10]} />
    <e.mesh theatreKey="Cube">
      <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial color="orange" />
    </e.mesh>
  </SheetProvider>
</Canvas>
```

Making the camera editable is a little trickier. Since it is not an intrinsic element, but a component exposed by `@react-three/drei`, we can't use the `e.elementName` shortcut.
We instead need to make an editable component out of it, which we can then use in our JSX.

First, create an editable camera component from drei's PerspectiveCamera.

```tsx
const EditableCamera = e(PerspectiveCamera, 'perspectiveCamera')
```

Then replace the `<PerspectiveCamera />` element with `<EditableCamera />`.

```tsx
<Canvas camera={{ position: [5, 5, -5] }}>
  <SheetProvider sheet={getProject('Demo Project').sheet('Demo Sheet')}>
    <EditableCamera theatreKey="Camera" makeDefault position={[5, 5, -5]} fov={75} />
    <ambientLight />
    <e.pointLight theatreKey="Light" position={[10, 10, 10]} />
    <e.mesh theatreKey="Cube">
      <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial color="orange" />
    </e.mesh>
  </SheetProvider>
</Canvas>
```

## Animating objects

So far, we can move around these objects and edit their properties, but we can also animate them.
To start animating, we first have to sequence the properties of an object we want to animate.
To sequence properties: select an object, right-click on a property (or group of properties) in the property editor panel, and click "sequence".
After clicking "sequence", the sequence editor will open. In this guide, we'll use the sequence editor to animate our cube to do a little dance.

<Screenshot src="/images/docs/0.5/getting-started/with-react-three-fiber/sequence-props.gif" />

To animate the cube's position, we'll create some keyframes by
clicking in the Sequence Editor to move the playhead to a different time in the animation and then dragging the cube around or modifying its position properties.
We use these keyframes to set where the cube will be at specific times in the animation.

<Screenshot src="/images/docs/0.5/getting-started/with-react-three-fiber/animate.gif" />

Once we have some keyframes in the sequence editor, we can play our animation by pressing `Space`.

<Callout type="info">Tip: If the Studio UI gets in the way, you can hide it by pressing `Alt/Option + \`.</Callout>

## Getting ready for production

So far, we've created some keyframes in the sequence editor that result in an animation. You can preview your animation by pressing `Space`.
All the keyframes you created are saved in your browser's `localStorage`.
So, your animation will be remembered between page refreshes.
But now you may want a way to save, share/publish, and programmatically play your animation.

To distribute your animation as a part of your website, export your Theatre.js Project by clicking on "Demo Project" in the outline menu in the top left of the UI,
and then click the "Export Demo Project to JSON" button on the right.

<Screenshot src="/images/docs/0.5/getting-started/with-react-three-fiber/export-state.png" />

This will download a JSON file `state.json`. Now, we can move `state.json` to the folder containing our web project, and import the JSON file:

```ts
import demoProjectState from './state.json'
```

Then replace our code from before:

```ts
getProject('Demo Project')
```

with this new code:

```ts
getProject('Demo Project', { state: demoProjectState })
```

We are now passing the saved animation state to [getProject](/docs/0.5/api/core#getproject).
By doing this, The Theatre.js Project will be initialized with the saved animation from `state.json` instead of with the animation saved in `localStorage`.
Don't worry; any changes you make to your animation in Studio will still be saved to `localStorage` after you do this (your edits will still survive page refreshes).

The last thing left is programmatically playing your animation.
Perhaps you will want to play the animation when the App component mounts,
or you may want to play it in response to events like a button-click.
Here, we'll use code to play the animation in a `useEffect` inside our `App` component.

To play an animation, we need to get a reference to its [sequence](/docs/0.5/concepts#sequences) and call the [play](/docs/0.5/api/core#sequence.play) method on it.
[Sequence.play](/docs/0.5/api/core#sequence.play) accepts a number of options.
Here, we are going to instruct Theatre.js to play the animation forever and in the range between the `0` second and the `1` second mark:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    demoSheet.project.ready.then(() => demoSheet.sequence.play({ iterationCount: Infinity, range: [0, 1] }))
  }, [])

  return (
    <Canvas camera={{ position: [5, 5, -5] }}>
      <SheetProvider sheet={demoSheet}>
        <EditableCamera theatreKey="Camera" makeDefault position={[5, 5, -5]} fov={75} />
        <ambientLight />
        <e.pointLight theatreKey="Light" position={[10, 10, 10]} />
        <e.mesh theatreKey="Cube">
          <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
          <meshStandardMaterial color="orange" />
        </e.mesh>
      </SheetProvider>
    </Canvas>
  )
}
```

In summary, your `main.tsx` should now have the following code:

```tsx
import './index.css'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'
import studio from '@theatre/studio'
import extension from '@theatre/r3f/dist/extension'
import { SheetProvider, editable as e } from '@theatre/r3f'
import { getProject } from '@theatre/core'
import demoProjectState from './state.json'

studio.initialize()
studio.extend(extension)

const demoSheet = getProject('Demo Project', { state: demoProjectState }).sheet('Demo Sheet')

const App = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    demoSheet.project.ready.then(() => demoSheet.sequence.play({ iterationCount: Infinity, range: [0, 1] }))
  }, [])

  return (
    <Canvas camera={{ position: [5, 5, -5] }}>
      <SheetProvider sheet={demoSheet}>
        <EditableCamera theatreKey="Camera" makeDefault position={[5, 5, -5]} fov={75} />
        <ambientLight />
        <e.pointLight theatreKey="Light" position={[10, 10, 10]} />
        <e.mesh theatreKey="Cube">
          <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
          <meshStandardMaterial color="orange" />
        </e.mesh>
      </SheetProvider>
    </Canvas>
  )
}

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(<App />)
```

To check what our page looks like without the Studio, we can press `Alt/Option + \` to hide it. Alternatively, we can comment out `studio.initialize()`.

## Deploying to production

When we are done and ready to deploy our webpage to production, we only need to do two things.

1. Make sure that we have the latest project state exported to a JSON file and passed to [getProject](/docs/0.5/api/core#getproject).
2. Remove [studio.initialize](/docs/0.5/api/studio#studio.initialize) and [studio.extend](/docs/0.5/api/studio#studio.extend).

We can also achieve the last step without manually editing the code every time by using environment-checks and relying on our bundler's tree-shaking feature:

```ts
// Vite
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
  studio.initialize()
  studio.extend(extension)
}
```

```ts
// create-react-app
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  studio.initialize()
  studio.extend(extension)
}
```

## Next steps
